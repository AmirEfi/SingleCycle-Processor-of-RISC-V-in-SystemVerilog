# Single-Cycle-Processor-of-RISC-V
## Update the Single Cycle Processor of RISC-V to support 'auipc' and 'xor' instructions

This is one of my assignments in Computer Architecture course in Spring 2022.

In this project, I changed the processor to handle the new instructions.

The riscvtest.txt has some examples of instructions to check that the processor works correctly.
